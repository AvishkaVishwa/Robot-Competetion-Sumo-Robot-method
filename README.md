Autonomous Box-Removing Robot

This is an autonomous car project that I'm building for a competition held by my university.

The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous robot capable of navigating within a defined area, detecting obstacles (boxes), and removing them efficiently to minimize travel time. The robot should perform these tasks autonomously without external control.
